# CUDA-Accelerated Optimization Algorithms: Implementation and Python Integration for Neural Network Training
 This project involves the development and integration of several key optimization algorithms—Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop—using CUDA for efficient computation on GPUs. The project provides a Python interface to these CUDA implementations, facilitating their use in training neural networks. The focus is on enhancing performance through parallel processing and making advanced optimization techniques accessible for practical machine learning applications.
